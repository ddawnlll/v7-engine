# S6 — V7/AlphaForge Integration & Rollout

# Part 1 — Phase Plan

## 0. TL;DR / Compact Mental Model

**Phase:** `S6`
**One-line goal:** Complete rollout so V7 and AlphaForge consume /simulation as the authority.
**Why now:** The /simulation authority must be integrated into both consuming systems before it provides real value. Old V7 simulation docs must become pointers.
**Blast radius:** simulation/**, v7/docs/**, alphaforge/docs/**
**Rollback path:** Revert this phase's workspaces, restore previous compatible state, and rerun targeted + final validation.
**Execution class:** `implementation`
**Execution automation:** `enabled`
**Scale mode:** `stable_3`
**Safe parallelism target:** `2`
**Done when:** All workspaces pass acceptance criteria and phase JSON validates through Pi doctor.

## 2. Purpose

The /simulation authority must be integrated into both consuming systems before it provides real value. Old V7 simulation docs must become pointers.

V7 runtime currently documents simulation internally. AlphaForge P2 references V7 simulation API. Both must be updated to consume /simulation through stable contracts/adapters.

This phase uses `stable_3` scale-aware execution. The executor should optimize for safe effective parallelism, not maximum concurrency. Worktree isolation, integration queue, validation locks, and completion gates remain mandatory whenever more than three workers are requested.

---

## 3. What Carried Over — Must Stay Stable

* [ ] Runtime owns orchestration, execution, persistence, lifecycle, and hard safety.
* [ ] /simulation owns economic truth semantics and contracts.
* [ ] V7 runtime hosts/executes simulation operationally through stable contracts.
* [ ] AlphaForge consumes /simulation outputs through deterministic side-effect-free adapters.
* [ ] lib/ stays primitive; simulation is NOT in lib/.
* [ ] No hidden label-only or backtest-only simulator.
* [ ] No hidden deterministic veto; regime constraints are policy-layer only.
* [ ] NO_TRADE remains first-class action.
* [ ] Version bumps are explicit; no silent semantic drift.
* [ ] Monte Carlo is diagnostic; does not replace realized truth.
* [ ] Worktree isolation remains available when requested.
* [ ] Integration queue remains enabled when required.
* [ ] Global validation lock remains active for heavy validation.
* [ ] Completion gate hardening remains active.
* [ ] Merge conflicts produce handoff artifacts and do not mark the plan complete.
* [ ] The next plan does not start while the integration queue is dirty.
* [ ] `git push` remains forbidden.
* [ ] Raw destructive cleanup remains forbidden.
* [ ] Watch-mode validation remains forbidden.
* [ ] The ExecutionKernel remains the source of truth for state transitions; executors and actors emit events only.

## 4. Background / What Was Wrong

V7 runtime currently documents simulation internally. AlphaForge P2 references V7 simulation API. Both must be updated to consume /simulation through stable contracts/adapters.

---

## 5. Current Failure State / Known Blockers

* V7 runtime host rollout = not completed.
* TradeOutcome normalization = not integrated with /simulation.
* AlphaForge P2 label pipeline = not consuming /simulation.
* Evaluation/promotion integration = not using /simulation.
* Old V7 simulation docs = not replaced with pointers.
* Rollback/compatibility plan = not defined.

---

## 6. Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Worktree isolation violation | low | critical | Path scope checks; stop execution on escape |
| Integration queue merges unvalidated diff | medium | high | Require workspace validation and integration validation |
| Merge conflict blocks plan | medium | medium | Generate conflict handoff artifact and stop queue safely |
| Safe parallelism is lower than requested | medium | medium | Doctor warning; show bottleneck; use safe batch preview |
| Validation lock limits throughput | medium | medium | Scheduler reduces concurrency while heavy validation runs |

## 9. Definition of Done

`S6` is complete when ALL are true:

* [ ] V7 runtime imports /simulation engine through stable contracts.
* [ ] TradeOutcome fields mapped from SimulationOutput.
* [ ] AlphaForge label builder calls /simulation training adapter.
* [ ] AlphaForge evaluation uses /simulation evaluation adapter.
* [ ] All /simulation docs finalized and internally consistent.
* [ ] Rollback documented: restore V7 docs from git, remove /simulation dir.
* [ ] DAG batch preview has been reviewed if required.
* [ ] Safe batch preview has been reviewed if required.
* [ ] Selected scale mode readiness passes.
* [ ] Worktree isolation is valid for selected scale mode.
* [ ] Integration queue status is clean or intentionally blocked with handoff.
* [ ] No forbidden commands or files were used.
* [ ] Validation gates passed.

---

## 10. Rollback Playbook

**Trigger conditions:** Worktree isolation violation, integration queue corruption, merge conflicts not detected.
**Procedure:** 1. Set scale to stable_3. 2. Reduce workers to 3. 3. Pause integration queue. 4. Preserve .pi/worktrees for debugging. 5. Revert phase commits independently.

---

## 11. What Next Phase Inherits

`NONE` inherits: Execution contract with worktree mode, scale-mode validation rules, integration queue requirements, workspace metadata, and review hardening invariants.

---

# Part 2 — Agent Brief

## Mission

Implement `S6` — Complete rollout so V7 and AlphaForge consume /simulation as the authority.

The agent must optimize for safe parallelism, not maximum concurrency.

## Hard Requirements

1. All S6 workstreams must pass acceptance criteria.
2. Worktree isolation must be enabled for parallel workspaces.
3. Integration queue must serialize merges.
4. Global validation lock active for heavy validation.
5. Watch-mode validation forbidden.
6. `git push` forbidden.
7. Raw destructive cleanup forbidden.
8. Do not exceed worker cap (3).
9. Do not merge unvalidated workspace output.
10. Do not mark plan complete if integration validation fails.

## Execution Policies

```yaml
execution_automation:
  autonomous_execution_enabled: true
  agent_may_mutate_repo: true
  agent_may_run_commands: true

scale:
  selected_mode: stable_3
  max_parallel_workspaces: 3
  worktree_required: true
  integration_queue_required: true

validation:
  global_validation_lock_required: true
  watch_mode_forbidden: true
```


# Part 2.5 — v4 ExecutionKernel Doctrine

## 2.5.1 Single Authority Model

v4 replaces executor-owned execution state with an ExecutionKernel model. All actors emit events.
WorkspaceAttemptController mutates attempt state. PlanSupervisor mutates plan state.
PostgreSQL stores authoritative runtime truth.

## 2.5.2 ExecutionKernel Components

| Component | Responsibility | May mutate execution state? |
|---|---|---:|
| ExecutionAdmissionGate | Authorize or reject execution requests before runtime starts | No |
| ExecutionProfileDeriver | Convert intent to required mechanisms | No |
| PlanSupervisor | Own plan FSM, slot tokens, completion predicate, final validation | Yes, plan state only |
| WorkspaceAttemptController | Own attempt FSM, retries, terminalization, handoff creation | Yes, attempt state only |
| StateStoreWriter | Commit transitions with authority token | Yes, through token only |
| AttemptEventJournal | Append versioned event records | No state mutation by itself |
| DeadlineWatchdog | Detect expired attempts and emit events | No |
| ExecutorActor | Run LLM/tools/bash for an attempt | No |
| ValidationActor | Run validation with deadlines and process containment | No |
| GitRunner | Serialize Git repo mutations | No attempt state mutation |

## 2.5.3 Attempt FSM Doctrine

QUEUED -> RUNNING -> VALIDATING -> SUCCEEDED
Failure: RUNNING+timeout -> TIMED_OUT, critical -> FAILED_FINAL
Terminal: SUCCEEDED, FAILED_RETRYABLE, FAILED_FINAL, TIMED_OUT, HANDOFF_REQUIRED

## 2.5.4 PostgreSQL Truth Doctrine

Runtime truth is PostgreSQL. JSON fallback is forbidden in production.

## 2.5.5 Intent-Driven Plan Doctrine

v4 authors express what they want, not the low-level mechanism matrix.
